                <hr>
                <p>
                    I am 21 years old and I was born and grown up in Kocani, Republic of North Macedonia. I have finished primary and secondary vocational school in my home town. I studied Hardware and other subjects from the field of software and programming. That is the
                    place where I learnt about C++, Pascal and some things about HTML. We only learnt some basic things about HTML in my vocational school. The tasks and problems with C++ and Pascal were mostly logical ones. During those classes I learnt
                    about the basics of programming like if, while, doâ€¦while, for, arrays as well as with functions. My basic source for learning about programming in that time were the things that our professors taught us and I used to spend a lot of
                    time during the weekends on solving logical problems in programming with my cousin. I became interested in programming while I was studying in my vocational school so I decided that I want to study something connected with programming.
                    I was also interested in finding out more about the way the operating system that is installed in the computer works and that is why I started studying Computer and software engineering at the Technical University of Sofia. I decided
                    to study in Bulgaria because there are many reputable universities and the students have many opportunities to work while they are studying and in that way they can deepen their knowledge in their specific area and increase their potential
                    whereas the opportunities are not so good in my country. During the first semester at the University we learnt the basis of C where I revised and extended my knowledge about working with text files. We continued with C in the following
                    semester and in that period of my studies I learnt how to work with binary files, I studied about structure where we learnt about LIFO and FIFO. I also learnt how to work with pointers which is more specific about C++. During the next
                    semester we learnt about objects, the basics of OOP and we extended about different data structure. We learnt and solved tasks and programs with threads. This subject was in Java so I enrolled on the course of Java Fundamentals in
                    SoftUni. In the fourth semester I learnt about some algorithms in C++ and we had the subject database and we learnt it with MySQL. Before the beginning of the fifth semester I enrolled on a Macedonian academy where I study online about
                    full-stack. There I learnt a lot about HTML and CSS. During this fifth semester I am learning OOP in C++ and in the subject about operative systems I am learning the processes as well as threads on C and C++.

                <p>I started playing sports when I was very young but it was mostly as a recreational activity. I stared playing many computer games in my teenage years. At younger age my hobbies were mainly playing basketball and karate and playing computer
                    games. I reduced the amount of time spent on playing computer games before I started going to the vocational school and after a while I completely stopped doing it. My schedule in the vocational school overlapped with the sports activities.
                    That's why I decaded to join the handball club. I liked handball very much but after a long time of playing team sports I decided to try individual ones. That is why I started going to the gym and running. I was progressing in running
                    so I decided to increase the training load and I started preparing for the half marathon, but I wasn't sure if I will be able to finish it. When I saw that with the help of my good physical and mental readiness I managed to finish
                    the first half marathon, I ran again in the folloing two years. The Covid 19 cancelled the sports events this year so I stopped going running that often. But I still go to the gym. During the lockdown I exercise at home. When I enrolled
                    at the university I became interested in reading books about personal growth and development and that is one of my present hobbies now.
